![Last successful run](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jginsburgn/us-macro-calendar/main/badge.json)

This repository publishes a **self-updating `.ics` calendar** containing major
US macroeconomic events that frequently move markets — including:

- **BLS** — CPI, Employment Situation (Non-Farm Payrolls), PPI, etc.
- **BEA** — GDP releases, Personal Income & Outlays (incl. PCE), etc.
- **Federal Reserve (FOMC)** — meeting rate-decision days

The calendar file is automatically regenerated by **GitHub Actions** and can be
subscribed to from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and others.
